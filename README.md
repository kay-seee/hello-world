# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Kellie C. I am a part-time student in South East Technological University. 
I am very much so a mature student - it took me many years to build the courage to "try out college". 
I am hoping to look back at this and laugh at my innocence or go bright red with embarrassment!!
